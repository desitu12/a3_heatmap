This project presents an interactive heatmap visualization of road accidents in the UK over a two-year period. Its primary goal is to reveal temporal accident patterns, such as whether accidents are more frequent on certain days of the week or hours of the day. A detailed explanation is given below.

The initial heatmap displays the total number of accidents for each combinatior of weekday and hour. Further patterns can be explored through several interactive controls:

1. FIlter by day and hour
Although the full matrix is visible by default, the view can be restricted to specific days or hours to focus the attention on them (e.g. weekday evenings from 17 to 19)
2. Filter by accident severity
The heatmap can be restricted to show only fatal accidents, serious accidents, and slight accidents
3. Filter by season (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall)
4. Hover interaction 
Hovering over any cell shows the exact number of accident at that day and hour, which is especially useful when color differences are subtle (e.g. during the night on weekdays)
5. Animated transition
A smooth color transition animates changes whenever filters are applied, helping the viewer perceive updates more naturally. 

Generative AI disclosure:
Generative AI tools (ChatGPT) has been used for the following purposes: 
1. Enhancing visual design (e.g. improving layout and styling choices such as color fading on the page, not the heatmap logic itself)
2. Small code snippets and debugging help for specific implementation issues
3. Final review and refinement of code structure 

All core ideas, functionality, and logic were developed manually.
